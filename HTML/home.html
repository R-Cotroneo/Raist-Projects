        <h2>Garfield Fanfic</h2>
        <p>
            His curly hair. His slender physique. His long,
            graceful strides. Jon Arbuckle wasnâ€™t a flawless
            Greek god, but to Garfield, he was pretty damn close.
            However, instead of their usual flirting, the apartment
            was full of a tense, uncomfortable atmosphere.
